# Hey, I’m TeakMirror 👋

Full-stack dev turning my systems + backend brain toward Web3.  
I build fast stuff, break slower stuff, and explore how blockchains actually work under the hood.

---

## ⚡ What I Do
- Full-stack: **Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js**
- Systems & infra: **Linux, NixOS, Docker, CI/CD**
- Web3 (exploring): **Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat, viem, wagmi**

---

## 🔍 Current Curiosity Loop
Smart contracts → EVM internals → dApp wiring → on-chain data → cross-chain bridges.

---

## 🧪 Building + Learning
- Tiny contracts + Foundry tests  
- dApp experiments in Next.js  
- RPCs, nodes, indexing, and bridge mechanics  
- Writing short tech notes as I go

---

> learning → shipping → breaking → fixing → repeat
